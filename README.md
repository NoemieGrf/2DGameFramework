## Coordinates

### Tile coordinate:

(0, 0) at left bottom corner, x goes right and y goes up. Tile coordinate is generated by LevelMap.txt, 
and only has int coordinate value, float should not appear in tile coordinate.

- world coordinate -> tile coordinate:

    example: world pos (5.4, 6.3) -> tile pos (5, 6).


- tile coordinate -> world coordinate:

    example: tile pos (5, 6) -> world pos (5.0, 6.0).

### World coordinate:

Base on tile coordinates, x goes right and y goes up, which are same with tile coordinates.

- where is the center of object?
  
Center coordinate = tile coordinate + (width / 2, height / 2). 
If we create a box, whose size is 1 width and 1 height, located at tile position (3, 4), 
the world position of center should be (3.5, 4.5).

### Screen coordinate:

In SFML, scrren coordinate let x goes right and y goes down, and x & y represent for pixels.
In game, the center of screen is always located at the center of player.
